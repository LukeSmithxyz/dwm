18:17 < Biolunar> when i change my resolution in dwm (to a smaller one) and then back to the native, the top bar is not repainted. that's since 5.7.2, in 5.6 it worked fine
18:19 < Biolunar> is it just happening to me or a (known) bug?
18:24 < Biolunar> and in addition, mplayers fullscreen is limited to the small resolution after i changed it back to the native

reproducible with xrandr -s but not with --output and --mode, strange

> another corner case:

a tiled client can be resized with mod+right click, but it only works
on the main monitor

dmenu appears on the monitor where the pointer is and not on selmon


yet another corner case:
open a terminal, focus another monitor, but without moving the mouse
pointer there
if there is no client on the other monitor to get the focus, then the
terminal will be unfocused but it will accept input

Donald Allen reported this:

starting emacs from dmenu in archlinux results in missing configure of emacs, but mod1-space or mod1-shift-space fix this problem. this problem is new and did not happen in 1.6 xorg servers

Starting emacs from xterm doesnt show this problem, he uses tag 8 for emacs

This is a known bug (for some curiosity I received the same report via 
privmail from 2 other people within one week, really strange). 
The quick fix is commenting out the code in lines 817/818 in hg tip 
dwm. I cannot confirm this has no side effects (I think it does) and I 
will address this issue shortly with a real fix.
