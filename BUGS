18:17 < Biolunar> when i change my resolution in dwm (to a smaller one) and then back to the native, the top bar is not repainted. that's since 5.7.2, in 5.6 it worked fine
18:19 < Biolunar> is it just happening to me or a (known) bug?
18:24 < Biolunar> and in addition, mplayers fullscreen is limited to the small resolution after i changed it back to the native

reproducible with xrandr -s but not with --output and --mode, strange

> another corner case:

a tiled client can be resized with mod+right click, but it only works
on the main monitor

dmenu appears on the monitor where the pointer is and not on selmon


yet another corner case:
open a terminal, focus another monitor, but without moving the mouse
pointer there
if there is no client on the other monitor to get the focus, then the
terminal will be unfocused but it will accept input
