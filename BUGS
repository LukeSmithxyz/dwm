18:17 < Biolunar> when i change my resolution in dwm (to a smaller one) and then back to the native, the top bar is not repainted. that's since 5.7.2, in 5.6 it worked fine
18:19 < Biolunar> is it just happening to me or a (known) bug?
18:24 < Biolunar> and in addition, mplayers fullscreen is limited to the small resolution after i changed it back to the native

reproducible with xrandr -s but not with --output and --mode, strange

yet another corner case:
open a terminal, focus another monitor, but without moving the mouse
pointer there
if there is no client on the other monitor to get the focus, then the
terminal will be unfocused but it will accept input

Donald Allen reported this:

starting emacs from dmenu in archlinux results in missing configure of emacs, but mod1-space or mod1-shift-space fix this problem. this problem is new and did not happen in 1.6 xorg servers

voltaic reports this:

When I use two monitors, one larger in resolution than the other, the
bar is drawn using the smaller x-dimension on both screens. I think
what's happening is that there are two bars drawn, but the short bar
is always on top of the long bar such that I can't see the information
under the short bar. If I switch to the small screen, hide the short
bar, and then switch to the large screen, the long bar is drawn
correctly.

A similar problem occurs when I have started dwm on a small resolution
monitor (laptop screen) and then I switch to a large external display.
When I do this, the bar itself is drawn for the original smaller
resolution, but the information to be printed on the bar is
right-aligned for a longer bar. So what I see is a bar that has the
right hand side of it cut-off. See attached screenshot.

I am using standard options for xrandr such as --output VGA1 --auto, etc.
