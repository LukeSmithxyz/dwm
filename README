gridwm is an automatic X11 window manager which arranges all windows in a grid.


Requirements

In order to build gridwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup. gridwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default.

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install gridwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running gridwm
--------------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start gridwm using startx:

In order to connect gridwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:
