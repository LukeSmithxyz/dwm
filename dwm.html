			<h3>dynamic window manager</h3>
		</center>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
		dwm is a dynamic window manager for X11.
		</p>
		<h3>Philosophy</h3>
		<p>
		As founder and main developer of wmii I came to the conclusion that
		wmii is too clunky for my needs. I don't need so many funky features
		and all this hype about remote control through a 9P service, I only
		want to manage my windows in a simple, but dynamic way. wmii never got
		finished because I listened to users, who proposed arbitrary ideas I
		considered useful. This resulted in an extreme <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/cadt.html">CADT</a>
		development model, which was a mistake. Thus the philosophy of
		dwm is simply <i>to fit my needs</i> (maybe yours as well). That's it.
		</p>
		<h3>Differences to wmii</h3	
		<p>
		In contrast to wmii, dwm is only a window manager, and nothing else.
		Hence, it is much smaller, faster and simpler.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			dwm has no 9P support, no status bar, no menu, no editable tagbars,
			no shell-based configuration and remote control and comes without
			any additional tools like printing the selection or warping the
			mouse.
			</li>
			<li>
			dwm is only a single binary, it's source code is intended to never
			exceed 2000 SLOC.
			</li>
			<li>
			dwm is customized through editing its source code, that makes it
			extremely fast and secure - it does not process any input data which
			hasn't been known at compile time, except window title names.
			</li>
			<li>
			dwm is based on tagging and dynamic window management (however simpler
			than wmii or larswm).
			</li>
			<li>
			dwm don't distinguishes between layers, there is no floating or
			managed layer. Wether the clients of currently selected tag are
			managed or not, you can re-arrange all clients on the fly. Popup-
			and fixed-size windows are treated unmanaged. 
			</li>
			<li>
			dwm uses 1-pixel borders to provide the maximum of screen real
			estate to clients. Small titlebars are only drawn in front of unfocused
			clients.
			</li>
			<li>
			garbeam <b>does not</b> want any feedback to dwm. If you ask for support,
			feature requests, or if you report bugs, they will be <b>ignored</b>
			with a high chance. dwm is only intended to fit garbeams needs.
			However you are free to download and distribute/relicense it, with the
			conditions of the <a href="http://wmii.de/cgi-bin/hgwebdir.cgi/dwm?f=f10eb1139362;file=LICENSE;style=raw">MIT/X Consortium license</a>.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Development</h3>
		<p>
		dwm is actively developed in parallel to wmii. You can <a href="http://wmii.de/cgi-bin/hgwebdir.cgi/dwm">browse</a> its source code repository or get a copy using <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/">Mercurial</a> with following command:
		</p>
		<p>
		<code>hg clone http://wmii.de/cgi-bin/hgwebdir.cgi/dwm</code>
