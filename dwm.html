			<h3>dynamic window manager</h3>
		</center>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
		dwm is a dynamic window manager for X11.
		</p>
		<h4>Philosophy</h4>
		<p>
		As founder and main developer of wmii I came to the conclusion that
		wmii is too clunky for my needs. I don't need so many funky features
		and all this hype about remote control through a 9P service, I only
		want to manage my windows in a simple, but dynamic way. wmii never got
		finished because I listened to users, who proposed arbitrary ideas I
		considered useful. This resulted in an extreme <a
		href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/cadt.html">CADT</a> development model,
		which was a mistake. Thus the philosophy of dwm is simply <i>to fit my
		needs</i> (maybe yours as well). That's it.
		</p>
		<h4>Differences to ion, larswm, and wmii</h4>
		<p>
		In contrast to ion, larswm, and wmii, dwm is much smaller, faster and simpler.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			dwm has no Lua integration, no 9P support, no menu, no editable
			tagbars, no shell-based configuration, no remote control, and comes
			without any additional tools like printing the selection or warping
			the mouse.
			</li>
			<li>
			dwm is only a single binary, it's source code is intended to never
			exceed 2000 SLOC.
			</li>
			<li>
			dwm is based on tagging and dynamic window management (however
			simpler than ion, wmii or larswm). It manages windows in
			tiling and floating modes. Either mode can be applied dynamically,
			depending on the application in use and the task performed.
			</li>
			<li>
			dwm don't distinguishes between layers, there is no floating or
			tiled layer. Wether the clients of currently selected tag are in
			tiled mode or not, you can re-arrange all clients on the fly.
			Popup- and fixed-size windows are treated floating, however. 
			</li>
			<li>
			dwm is customized through editing its source code, that makes it
			extremely fast and secure - it does not process any input data
			which hasn't been known at compile time, except window title names
			and status text read from standard input. You don't have to learn
			Lua/sh/ruby or some weird configuration file format (like X
			resource files), beside C to customize it for your needs,
			you <b>only</b> have to learn C (at least editing header files).
			</li>
			<li>
			Because dwm is customized through editing its source code, it's
			pointless to make binary packages of it. This keeps its userbase
			small and elitist. No novices asking stupid questions.
			</li>
			<li>
			dwm uses 1-pixel borders to provide the maximum of screen real
			estate to clients. Small titlebars are only drawn in front of
			unfocused clients.
			</li>
			<li>
			dwm reads from standard input to print arbitrary status text (like
			the date, load, battery charge). That's much simpler than
			larsremote, wmiir and what not...
			</li>
			<li>
			It can be downloaded and distributed under the conditions
			of the <a href="http://10kloc.org/cgi-bin/hgwebdir.cgi/dwm?f=f10eb1139362;file=LICENSE;style=raw">MIT/X Consortium license</a>.
